# ANN Model Selection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for training datasets on built models and selecting the best model based on minimum cross-validation Mean Squared Error (MSE). This solution is particularly effective for small models and light datasets.

## Features

- Train multiple models on a given dataset.
- Evaluate models using cross-validation.
- Automatically select the model with the lowest cross-validation MSE.
- Easily extensible to include additional models and evaluation metrics.
